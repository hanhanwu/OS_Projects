Small Project 1

* CMake: CMake is an extensible, open-source system that manages the build process in an operating system and in a compiler-independent manner. Unlike many cross-platform systems, CMake is designed to be used in conjunction with the native build environment.
* Install cmake on Mac: http://tudat.tudelft.nl/projects/tudat/wiki/Install_on_Mac_OS_X
* LLVM: The LLVM compiler infrastructure project (formerly Low Level Virtual Machine) is a "collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies" used to develop compiler front ends and back ends.
* LLVM Programmer Manual: http://llvm.org/docs/ProgrammersManual.html
* LLVM Language Reference Manual: http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html
* Bitcode is an intermediate representation of a compiled program.
* IR - Intermediate Representation code, the heart of LLVM, https://idea.popcount.org/2013-07-24-ir-is-better-than-assembly/
* SSA -  static single assignment form is a property of an intermediate representation (IR), which requires that each variable is assigned exactly once, and every variable is defined before it is used.
* LLVM has phi instruction with quite weird explanation: The 'phi' instruction is used to implement the Ï† node in the SSA graph representing the function. Typically it is used to implement branching.
